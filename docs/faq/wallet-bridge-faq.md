## How to switch to Matic mainnet?

Assuming that you have already added the network and custom RPC for Matic mainnet in your Metamask wallet here is how you can switch:

1. Open your Metamask wallet and click on the network dropdown to expand as shown in figure:

2. Once the window expands you can select Matic Network to switch.

You have now switched to Matic mainnet.

You can refer to this link if you are looking for instructions on how to add the network to Metamask: [https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic)

## I have deposited WETH but I don’t see it on Metamask. What do I do?

You need to manually add the custom token address of WETH to Metamask.

Open Metamask and scroll down to click on add tokens.

[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KXBiSkXtLJaP6f1uEeYOOU6Suj7II6g3Nw5EXLklIWujd7_Q56Bn5yfsRpZD5ouB87-qzUHNVmcGWche1G5A2zif0VTZ3rH9GTeuJR2fzi6YvUDCDsGEPWTukjNJbid7klNJwug8](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KXBiSkXtLJaP6f1uEeYOOU6Suj7II6g3Nw5EXLklIWujd7_Q56Bn5yfsRpZD5ouB87-qzUHNVmcGWche1G5A2zif0VTZ3rH9GTeuJR2fzi6YvUDCDsGEPWTukjNJbid7klNJwug8)

Then, select Custom Token to add the relevant contract address, symbol and the decimal precision. Contract addresses (PoS-WETH in this case) can be found on this link: [https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/network-details/mapped-tokens/](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/network-details/mapped-tokens/)

You will need to add the child token address to view balances on Matic mainnet.

Decimal of precision is 18 for WETH (generally, for most tokens decimal of precision is 18).

Once you fill in all the fields, you can click on next and your token will be added.

## Can I send my tokens from Matic to any other wallet/exchange ?

You cannot directly send tokens from Matic UI to Exchange/wallets. You have to first withdraw from Matic to Ethereum and then send it to your exchange address (unless your exchange/wallet explicitly supports the network).

## I made a mistake of sending funds to an exchange/wallet directly. Can you help?

Unfortunately, we can not assist in such cases. Please don't send funds directly to exchanges that support only Ethereum, you have to first withdraw from Matic to Ethereum and then send it to your exchange address.

## I made a mistake of sending funds to a address. Can you reverse it?

The Matic Web Wallet does not handle any user keys. They are stored in your Metamask wallet. All actions are user-generated. In case these funds weren’t transferred by you, then there is a possibility that your keys may have been compromised. We are not in a position to do anything about this since we explicitly do not handle any user keys to reverse a transaction.

## I am not able to login, what do I do?

[https://docs.matic.network/docs/validate/delegator-faq/#my-metamask-is-stuck-at-confirming-after-login-what-do-i-do-or-nothing-happens-when-i-try-to-login](https://docs.matic.network/docs/validate/delegator-faq/#my-metamask-is-stuck-at-confirming-after-login-what-do-i-do-or-nothing-happens-when-i-try-to-login)

## Does Matic support hardware wallets?

Yes, hardware wallets are supported.

## What can I do with my Matic wallet?
- Send funds to any account on Matic.
- Deposit funds from Ethereum to Matic (using the bridge).
- Withdraw funds back to Ethereum from Matic (also using the bridge).

## My token is not visible in the list. Who should I contact?

Reach out to the Polygon team on Discord or Telegram and get your token listed. Before that, ensure your token is mapped. If it is not mapped, please raise a request at [https://mapper.matic.today/](https://mapper.matic.today/)

## What are some best practices to follow?
- When you want to send funds from Matic to Ethereum, use the withdraw functionality. Do not use the send functionality. This will lead to loss of funds.
- Do not deposit to the Matic mainnet if you wish to participate in staking only.
- Do not change the gas limit from Metamask.

## What do I do if the deposit is confirmed but the balance is not getting updated?

It takes 7-8 minutes for the deposit transaction to complete. Please wait for some time and click on "refresh balance".

## What should I do if the checkpoint is not happening?

Checkpoints sometimes take more that 45 minutes to 1 hour based on network congestion on Ethereum, we suggest waiting for a while before raising a ticket.

## I am trying to withdraw, but the challenge period is taking more than 7 days, how long should I wait?

It can take a bit more than 7 days sometimes. Kindly wait or reach out to the Polygon team if its taking too long at [](https://desk.zoho.in/portal/maticsupport/en/home)[https://wallet-support.matic.network/](https://wallet-support.matic.network/)

## Is it possible to cancel a withdraw transaction?

No, you have to complete the next steps. If the current gas price is too high, then please wait and try later when the price goes down.

## Why is there a 7 day challenge period?

Plasma bridge comes with a plasma security challenge period of 7 days in which anyone can challenge the transaction that has happened on Matic.

## Why is the MATIC token is not supported on PoS?

MATIC is the native token of Matic network and it has a contract address - 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010 on the Matic chain. It is also used to pay gas. Mapping the MATIC token on the PoS bridge will lead to MATIC having an additional contract address on the MATIC chain. This will collide with the existing contract address as this new token address can not be used to pay for gas and will have to remain as a normal ERC20 token on the matic chain. Hence, to avoid this confusion, it was decided to retain MATIC only on Plasma.

## How do I map tokens?

Please raise a mapping request at [https://mapper.matic.today/](https://mapper.matic.today/)

## What do I do if the transaction is taking too long or if the gas price is too high?

Transaction time and gas price varies based on network congestion. If a high gas price is paid, then transaction gets confirmed faster.

## Can I change the gas limit or the gas price?

Gas limit is estimated and set by the application according to certain requirements of the function being called in the contract. This should not be edited. Only gas price can be changed in order to increase or decrease the transaction fees.

## What should I do if the transaction was cancelled but the web wallet shows transaction is completed?

Please reach out to our support team.
