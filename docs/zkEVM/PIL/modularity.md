# Modularity

## Introduction

Although several polynomials could be added to a state machine to express more operations, it would only make the design hard to test, audit, or formally verify.

In order to avoid this complication, PIL lets one use a divide and conquer technique:

1. Instead of developing one (big) state machine, a typical architecture consists of different state machines.

2. Each state machine is devoted to proving the execution of a specific task, each with its own set of constraints.

3. Then, relevant polynomials on different state machines are related and compared using lookup tables or permutation arguments.

4. This guarantees consistency as if it would have been a single state machine.

PIL is therefore best suited for a modular design of state machines.

Below figure depicts a connection between the polynomials $[a,b,c]$ and $[d,e,f]$.

To illustrate this process,

1. First, design a state machine to manage arithmetic operations over $2$-byte elements.
2. Then, connect this state machine with another state machine (that needs to perform arithmetic operations) via a lookup argument.

## The Arithmetic State Machine

The _Arithmetic State Machine_ is in charge of checking that some arithmetic operations like additions and multiplications are correctly performed over $2$-byte elements. For this, the polynomials; $\texttt{a}$, $\texttt{b}$, $\texttt{c}$, $\texttt{d}$, and $\texttt{e}$; must satisfy the identity:

$$
\texttt{a}(X) \cdot \texttt{b}(X) + \texttt{c}(X) = 2^{16} \cdot \texttt{d}(X) + \texttt{e}(X).
$$

Notice the following,

&rarr; The multiplication between $\texttt{a}$ and $\texttt{b}$, which are $2$-byte elements, can be expressed with $\texttt{e}$ and $\texttt{d}$, where these are also $2$-byte elements.

&rarr; Enforce that all the evaluations of $\texttt{a}$, $\texttt{b}$, $\texttt{c}$, $\texttt{d}$ and $\texttt{e}$ are $2$-byte elements.

Below figure shows how the Arithmetic State Machine is designed:

![Architecture of the Arithmetic State Machine](figures/fig13-arth-sm-arch.png)

Below table displays an example of how the computational trace looks like:

![Computational Trace of the Arithmetic State Machine](figures/fig14-arth-sm-arch.png)

The Arithmetic state machine works as follows. $\texttt{LATCH}$ is used to flag when the operation is ready. Note that $\texttt{SET}[A]$, $\texttt{SET}[B]$, $\texttt{SET}[C]$, $\texttt{SET}[D]$, $\texttt{SET}[E]$ and $\texttt{LATCH}$ are constant polynomials. $\texttt{freeIn}$ is committed, and contains the values on which arithmetic operations are performed. Polynomials $\texttt{a}$, $\texttt{b}$, $\texttt{c}$, $\texttt{d}$ and $\texttt{e}$ compose the state variables.

The polynomial identities that define the Arithmetic State Machine are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\texttt{freeIn} \subset [0,2^{16} - 1], \\
\texttt{a}' &= \texttt{SET}[A]\cdot(\texttt{freeIn} - \texttt{a}) + \texttt{a}, \\
\texttt{b}' &= \texttt{SET}[B]\cdot(\texttt{freeIn} - \texttt{b}) + \texttt{b}, \\
\texttt{c}' &= \texttt{SET}[C]\cdot(\texttt{freeIn} - \texttt{c}) + \texttt{c}, \\
\texttt{d}' &= \texttt{SET}[D]\cdot(\texttt{freeIn} - \texttt{d}) + \texttt{d}, \\
\texttt{e}' &= \texttt{SET}[E]\cdot(\texttt{freeIn} - \texttt{e}) + \texttt{e}, \\
0 &= [ \texttt{a} \cdot \texttt{b} + \texttt{c} - (2^{16} \cdot \texttt{d} + \texttt{e}) ] \cdot \texttt{LATCH}.
\end{aligned}
$$

These are included in PIL as shown in the code excerpt below.

## The Main State Machine

The _Main State Machine_ is in charge of some (major) tasks, but will specifically use the Arithmetic SM when Arithmetic operations needs to be performed over certain values.

![The Main State Machine Architecture](figures/fig15-main-sm-arch.png)

Hence, the first task in PIL is to introduce the various polynomials. It looks as follows,

![Arithmetic State Machine PIL Example](figures/fig15-pil-eg-main-sm.png)

Now, check whether all the input polynomials (wherever necessary) are present, and if some polynomial is intended to be boolean, then a constraint that reflects so must be added.

Now, add various constraints regarding the evolution of the "main" state variables $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ and $e$, so that any kind of linear combination between the main state variables, the free input and any constant is subject to be moved in the next iteration of some (or all) the state variables.

Below diagram shows the desired behavior of Boolean Polynommials in the Main State Machine:

![Boolean Polynommials in the Main State Machine](figures/fig16-main-sm-bool-pols.png)

In PIL, it translates to the following:

![Verification of Basic Registry Operations](figures/fig17-pil-vrfctn-reg-op.png)

Finally, the constraints reflecting the relationship between the Main and the Arithmetic SMs can be checked:

![PIL Example Connect Main and Arithmetic SMs](figures/fig18-pil-eg-cnnct-main-arth.png)

The connections can be depicted in terms of tables, as shown below:

![Connecting Arithmetic and Main State Machines](figures/fig18-main-cnnct-Arth-Main.png)

On the one side, the $\texttt{arith}$ selector is used in the Main SM to point to this state machine when an arithmetic lookup have to be performed. On the other side, the $\texttt{LATCH}$ selector, which also works as a selector for which rows should be added in the lookup argument is used. And, as illustrated in the figure above, this proves that,

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\texttt{Main.arith} \cdot [\texttt{Main.a} , \texttt{Main.b} , \texttt{Main.c} , \texttt{Main.d}, \texttt{Main.e}] \\ \subset \\ \texttt{Arith.LATCH} \cdot [\texttt{Arith.a}, \texttt{Arith.b}, \texttt{Arith.c}, \texttt{Arith.d}, \texttt{Arith.e}]
\end{array}
$$
