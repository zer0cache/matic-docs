What follows is a set of instructions to deposit and withdraw funds using [Polygon's network](https://wallet.polygon.technology/). For performing those actions, you need to connect a wallet to Polygon's environmnet. In this tutorial, we used Metamask, but Polygon is integrated with other wallets such as Coinbase, Bitski, Venly and WalletConnect.

:::note

Please refer to [<ins>this guide</ins>](docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/) to learn how to connect Polygon to Metamask.

## Logging into the Polygon Wallet Suite

To log into the Polygon Wallet Suite, you need to access the following URL: https://wallet.polygon.technology/.

Once you connect your account with the Web Wallet, you will be taken to the landing page with various means on how to transact with the web wallet. Polygon POS chain currently offers the following services:
- **Polygon Wallet** for sending, receiving, and storing your assets on the Polygon network
- **Polygon Bridge** for withdrawals and deposits across networks
- **Polygon Staking** as your go-to place for staking and getting rewards with your MATIC tokens
- **Widget Dashboard**

Click on the **Polygon Wallet** or **Polygon Bridge**, and you will see all your token balances on the Polygon Wallet across the bridges (PoS and Plasma).

Be attentive to all MetaMask popups. Throughout the deposit and withdraw processes, you will be prompted with MetaMask popups to confirm transactions, switch networks, and other procedures. You can only proceed with those transactions if you confirm the actions on MetaMask.
