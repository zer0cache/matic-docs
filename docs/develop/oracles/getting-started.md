There is often a need to access information from the outside world that is relevant to the contractual agreement. But smart contracts can't access data from outside of their blockchain network. An oracle is a way for a **blockchain or smart contract to interact with external data**.

With blockchains being deterministic one-way streets, an oracle is the path between off-chain and on-chain events. These oracles are services that send and verify real world occurrences and submit this information to smart contracts, triggering state changes on the blockchain.

Inbound oracles bring off-chain or real-world data to the blockchain, whereas their outbound cousins do the opposite: they inform an entity outside the blockchain of an event that occurred on it.

## Blockchain Oracles

To integrate your dApp with Oracles on Polygon, you can choose to go with one of the following solutions:

 1. [API3](api3.md)
 2. [Chainlink](chainlink.md)
 3. [BandChain](bandchain.md)
 4. [Razor](razor.md)
 5. [Tellor](tellor.md)
 6. [UMA](optimisticoracle.md)
