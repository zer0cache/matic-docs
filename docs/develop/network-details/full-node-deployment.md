This tutorial guides you through starting and running a full node using Ansible. For the system requirements, see the [Minimum Technical Requirements](technical-requirements) guide.

:::note

Steps in this guide involve waiting for the Heimdall and Bor services to fully sync. This process takes several days to complete.

Alternatively, you can use a maintained snapshot, which will reduce the sync time to a few hours. For detailed instructions, see [<ins>Snapshot Instructions for Heimdall and Bor</ins>](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/snapshot-instructions-for-heimdall-and-bor/9233).

For snapshot download links, see the [<ins>Polygon Chains Snapshots</ins>](https://snapshots.matic.today/) page.

## Full Node Deployment (Mumbai testnet)

The Ansible playbook is used to configure and manage a full node.

Pre-requisite:

- Ansible should be installed on local machine with Python3.x. The setup will not work if you have Python2.x.
    - To install ansible with Python 3.x you can use this command `pip3 install ansible`. This will install Python 3 dependencies as well as ansible.
- Check the [Polygon PoS Ansible repository](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#requirements) for requirements
- You will also need to make sure that Go is **not installed** in your environment. You will run into issues if you attempt to set up your full node through Ansible with Go installed as Ansible requires specific packages of Go to be installed.
- You will also need to make sure that your VM / Machine does not have any previous setups for Polygon Validator or Heimdall or Bor. You will need to delete them as your setup will run into issues.
- The latest version, [Heimdall v.0.2.11](https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/releases/tag/v0.2.11), contains a few enhancements. The delay time between the contract events of different validators **has been increased** to ensure that the mempool doesn't get filled very quickly in case of a burst of events which could hamper the progress of the chain. Additionally, the data size **has been restricted in state sync txs to 30Kb (when represented in bytes) and 60Kb (when represented as string)**. For example:

```bash
Data - "abcd1234"
Length in string format - 8
Hex Byte representation - [171 205 18 52]
Length in byte format - 4

```

## Full node setup for Testnetv4/Mumbai testnet

- Ensure you have access to the remote machine or VM that the full node is being set up on. Refer [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#setup](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#setup) for more details.
- Clone the [`https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible`](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible) repo
- Get into the node-ansible folder: `cd node-ansible`
- Edit the `inventory.yml` file and insert your IP(s) in the `sentry->hosts` section. Refer [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#inventory](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#inventory) for more details.
- Check if remote machine is reachable by running `ansible sentry -m ping`
- For a test run to confirm if the correct remote machine / VM is configured, run the following command:

```bash

ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/network.yml --extra-var="bor_branch=v0.2.16 heimdall_branch=v0.2.11 network_version=testnet-v4 node_type=sentry/sentry heimdall_network=mumbai" --list-hosts

```

It should output the remote machine IP(s) you have configured:

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/network/full-node-mumbai.png")} />

- Set up the full node with this command:

```bash

    ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/network.yml --extra-var="bor_branch=v0.2.16 heimdall_branch=v0.2.11 network_version=testnet-v4 node_type=sentry/sentry heimdall_network=mumbai"

```

- In case you run into any issues, delete and clean the whole setup using

    `ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/clean.yml`

- Log in to the remote machine
- Configure the following in `~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml`:
    - `moniker=<enter unique identifier>`
    - `seeds="4cd60c1d76e44b05f7dfd8bab3f447b119e87042@54.147.31.250:26656"`
- Configure the following in `~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml`:
    - `eth_rpc_url =<insert Infura or any full node RPC URL to Goerli>`
- Add the following flag in `~/node/bor/start.sh` to the `bor` start params:

```bash
--bootnodes "enode://320553cda00dfc003f499a3ce9598029f364fbb3ed1222fdc20a94d97dcc4d8ba0cd0bfa996579dcc6d17a534741fb0a5da303a90579431259150de66b597251@54.147.31.250:30303"
```

- In case you want to turn `trace` on for Bor, add the following flag to the `bor` start params in `~/node/bor/start.sh`:
    - `--gcmode 'archive'`

- Run the full node with the following commands:
    - `sudo service heimdalld start`
    - `sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start`

    Once Heimdall is synced, run

    - `sudo service bor start`

- Check logs:
    - Heimdall - `journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f`
    - Heimdall Rest Server - `journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f`
    - Bor - `journalctl -u bor.service -f`

- To check if Heimdall is synced
    - On the remote machine/VM, run `curl localhost:26657/status`
    - In the output, `catching_up` value should be `false`
