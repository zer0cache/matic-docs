[Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) is a tool that allows you to get free MATIC tokens on the Mumbai Testnet to help you get started with the Polygon network. These test tokens enable you to work with Polygon features without spending real MATIC on the Mainnet.

:::info

Tokens on testnet networks have no value as they are only used for testing purposes.
