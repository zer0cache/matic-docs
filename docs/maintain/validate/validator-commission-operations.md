You can set up and change your [commission](/docs/validate/glossary#commission) as a validator.

A validator is entitled to charge any commission rate. The minimum commission would be 0% and the maximum commission would be 100% of the rewards earned.

You are allowed to change the commission rates as many times as you would like.

As a validator, it is one of your responsibilities to inform the community on commission changes. See [Validator Responsibilities](/docs/validate/validator/responsibilities).

## Set up your commission rate as a validator

You set up the commission rate as part of your initial validator staking process. See [Validator Staking Operations](/docs/validate/validate/validator-staking-operations).

## Change your commission rate

You can change your commission rate.

1. With your owner address, login to the [staking dashboard](https://wallet.polygon.technology/staking/).
1. On your profile, click **Edit Profile**.
1. In the *Commission* field, provide your new commission rate.

Once you have confirmed and signed the transaction your commission rate will be set.

Once the commission is updated, there is a cool down period of 80 checkpoints.
