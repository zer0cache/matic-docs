# Performance Metrics Overview

:::note Section is being updated

Stay tuned!

:::

The Polygon Governance team administers an off-chain validator performance metric initative that assists validators in evaluating their network participation. Validators will eventually need to self-regulate network participation on Polygon to an agreed set of on-chain parameters as they network continues to decentralize. The validator performance metrics follow a benchmark calculation that evaluates validator performance.
