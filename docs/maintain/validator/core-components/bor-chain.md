The Bor node or the block producer implementation is the sidechain operator.

The sidechain VM is EVM-compatible. Currently, Bor is a basic Geth implementation with custom changes done to the consensus algorithm.

Block producers are chosen from the [validator](/docs/validate/glossary#validator) set and are shuffled using historical Ethereum block hashes.

See also [Bor architecture](/docs/contribute/bor/overview).
