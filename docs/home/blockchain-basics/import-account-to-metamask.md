By default, only ETH is listed in Metamask. If you already have Matic tokens then that too will be listed automatically. In order to view your other tokens, you can click on Add Tokens and search the token you want to be listed.

Do keep extreme care of your seed phrase and keep backups, because unlike exchanges, you need to keep your seed phrase safe. If the seed phrase is lost, funds are not recoverable. Also never share this seed phrase with anyone.

### Sending MATIC tokens from Binance and other exchanges to the Metamask wallet

Most exchanges like Binance and others have an option to withdraw funds from your exchange account to your address on the Ethereum blockchain. Once you have set up an account in Metamask, you will see the address of your account.

To send Matic tokens to Metamask, withdraw funds from your exchange account to the Metamask address. After some time, the funds will get reflected in the Metamask account.
