Polygon is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Polygon supports all existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

If you are looking to integrate with Polygon, you have come to the right place. If you are one of either:

- a blockchain wallet,
- meta-transaction provider,
- hosting blockchain full nodes or
- building a developer tool for Ethereum or other blockchains,

this section is for you.
